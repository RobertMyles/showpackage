packageshow is an R package for quickly showing package information like [`pip show`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_show/) does for Python. It is _not_ a package manager like miniCRAN, [jetpack](https://github.com/ankane/jetpack), [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) or any of those packages, and is not intended to be. 

## Usage
showpackage is designed for when you need to check package information quickly, from inside R or from the command line. 
Imagine you are installing R on a server without internet access and need to see package dependencies to maintain the outward tranquility of your lovely DevOps team members. With showpackage, it's easy. Imagine we want to double-check that [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) has no external dependencies. From the terminal on Mac, for example:

```bash
packageshow data.table
```

The result is:

Since R is not an _external_ dependency, and neither is [methods](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/methods/html/methods-package.html), we can see that we were right about data.table. 

We can also see how many of our installed packages depend on the package in question. Let's see how it is for [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html):

The `Required-by` field shows us that quite a lot of the packages I've installed utilise Rcpp. 

### Inside R

packageshow can be used from inside R too, which gives you the option of saving this info as a dataframe, should you want to. An example of both options:  

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(showpackage)
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
show_pkg("ggplot2", return_value = "data") %>% 
  as_tibble() # just for pretty printing
```

Or: 
```{r}
show_pkg("ggplot2")
```


## Inspiration

Python's `pip show` is really useful for quickly getting information for a particular package. R has a few tools for getting information on packages: `installed.packages()`; `tools::dependsOnPkgs()`; `packageVersion()`; `tools::package_dependencies()` as well as the package manager packages mentioned above; it also has [great tools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pkgnet/vignettes/pkgnet-intro.html) for [plotting networks](https://eranraviv.com/r-tips-and-tricks-package-dependencies/) of the dependencies between packages. All wonderful tools, but nothing that does exactly what `pip show` does, which is something I really like and appreciated when I needed it for getting Python package dependencies. Here's a comparison of `pip show` and `packageshow`:  

`pip show pandas` does:

```bash
Name: pandas
Version: 0.24.2
Summary: Powerful data structures for data analysis, time series, and statistics
Home-page: http://pandas.pydata.org
Author: None
Author-email: None
License: BSD
Location: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages
Requires: numpy, python-dateutil, pytz
```

`packageshow zoo` does:

```bash
Package: zoo
Version: 1.8-6
Depends: R (>= 3.1.0), stats
Imports: utils, graphics, grDevices, lattice (>= 0.20-27)
LinkingTo: None
Description: An S3 class with methods for totally ordered indexed
observations. It is particularly aimed at irregular time series
of numeric vectors/matrices and factors. zoo's key design goals
are independence of a particular index/date/time class and
consistency with ts and base R by providing methods to extend
standard generics.

### But who cares 'bout dependencies?? `r emo::ji("confused")`

[Lots of people.](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2018/02/28/#017_dependencies)

## Thanks
Big thanks to [Andrew Kane](https://github.com/ankane), who made jetpack. I followed similar logic to get a command line interface for packageshow.
